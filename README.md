# SEO-Marketing-Site

## Description

This project involved taking existing code that does work and brining it to sematic html standards.  It was also meant to meet accesibility standards. I built this project to get a better understanding of how to bring html code up standard practices. This project hopefully solves the problem of meeting standards with coding as well as ADA standards for accesibility. 

I learned from this project that writing in semantic html is essential for meeting today's standards.  It helps other coders understand what I have done and be able to input there own changes if neccesary.  I have also learned that the accesibility standards for images are imporant.  It makes it so the website is accesibile to people with disabilties and adheres to ADA standards.
